Object and array literals are two of the most frequently used notations in JavaScript, and thanks to the popular JSON data format, they have become a particularly
important part of the language.

The goal of this article is to define and clarify the different aspects of **‚ÄúDestructuring in JavaScript‚Äù**.

Lets take a closer look at,
  - **What and Why of Regular Expressions?**
  - **Array Destructuring**
  - **Object Destructuring**
  - **Parting Thoughts**

### What and Why of Regular Expressions?

> Regular expressions are sequences of characters and symbols that define a set of strings. They are useful for validating input and ensuring that data is in a particular format.

For example, a ZIP code must consist of five digits, and a last name must contain only letters, spaces, apostrophes and hyphens.

Quantifiers used in regular expressions


| Character | Matches            | Character | Matches                |   |
|-----------|--------------------|-----------|------------------------|---|
| \d        | any digit          | \D        | any non-digit          |   |
| \w        | any word character | \W        | any non-word character |   |
| \s        | any whitespace     | \S        | any non-whitespace     |   |


All of the quantifiers are greedy. This means that they will match as many occurrences as they can as long as the match is still successful.

However, if any of these quantifiers is followed by a question mark (?), the quantifier becomes reluctant (sometimes called lazy). It then will match as few occurrences as possible as long as the match is still successful. 

One application of regular expressions is to facilitate the construction of a compiler. If the program code does not match the regular expression, the compiler knows that there is a syntax error within the code.


### Validate User Information using Regular Expressions in Java


In Java, Class **String** provides several methods for performing regular-expression operations, the simplest of which is the matching operation. 

String method **_matches_** receives a string that specifies the regular expression and matches the contents of the String object on which it is called to the regular expression.

```java

public class ValidateInput {
	
	/** validates first name */
	public static boolean validateFirstName(String userFirstName) {
		return userFirstName.matches("[A-Z][a-zA-Z]*");
	}

	/** validates last name */
	public static boolean validateuserLastName(String userLastName) {
		return userLastName.matches("[a-zA-z]+([ '-][a-zA-Z]+)*");
	}

	/** validates address */
	public static boolean validateAddress(String address) {
		return address.matches("\\d+\\s+([a-zA-Z]+|[a-zA-Z]+\\s[a-zA-Z]+)");
	}

	/** validates city */
	public static boolean validateCity(String city) {
		return city.matches("([a-zA-Z]+|[a-zA-Z]+\\s[a-zA-Z]+)");
	}

	/** validates state */
	public static boolean validateState(String state) {
		return state.matches("([a-zA-Z]+|[a-zA-Z]+\\s[a-zA-Z]+)");
	}

	/** validates zip */
	public static boolean validateZip(String zip) {
		return zip.matches("\\d{5}");
	}

	/** validate phone */
	public static boolean validatePhone(String phone) {
		return phone.matches("[1-9]\\d{2}-[1-9]\\d{2}-\\d{4}");
	}

}

```


 
Please enter first name:
Jane
Please enter last name:
Doe
Please enter address:
123 Some Street
Please enter city:
Some City
Please enter state:
SS
Please enter zip:
123
Please enter phone:
123-456-7890
 
Validate Result:
Invalid zip code
  
### Parting Thoughts

  - You have learned that Destructuring makes working with objects and arrays in JavaScript easier.
  - You have seen that both object and array destructuring can specify default values for any property or item that is undefined, and both throw errors when the right side of an assignment evaluates to null or undefined.
  - You have also learned 
  - You'll end up using JavaScript's prototypal inheritance at many, a great feature of the language.
